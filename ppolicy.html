We may collect, store, and use the following kinds of personal information:<br>

Information about your computer and about your use of this website. This may include your IP address, your location, your browser type and version, your operating system, your referral source, your length of visit, your page views, and website navigation.<br>
Information relating to any transactions carried out between you and us on or in relation to our website. This may include information related to any purchases you make of our goods or services. We may also ask for your contact information, including information such as your name, your company name, your address, your email address, and your telephone number. We will never ask you to share any sensitive information.<br>
Information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to our website services, email notifications, and/or newsletters<br>
Information that you provide to us for in the form of support to our platform
How we use your information<br>

We use the information we collect from you in various ways, such as:<br>

to provide, operate, and maintain our services<br>
to improve, personalize, and expand our services<br>
to understand and analyze how you use our services;<br>
to develop new products, services, features, and functionalities
to communicate with you to provide you with updates and other information relating to our services<br>
to communicate with you for marketing and promotional purposes, when we have your previous consent<br>
to process your transactions
to keep our website secure and prevent fraud
to send you email notifications that you have specifically requested<br>
for compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service, or other legal rights, or as it may be required by applicable laws and regulations, or requested by any judicial process or governmental agencies<br>
We will not, without your express consent, share your personal information with any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.<br>

Data retention<br>

About you<br>

We retain the personal information we collect from you if we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so. For example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements.<br>

If and when we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it within 1 month after the legitimate business need has ended.
<br>
If this is not possible (e.g. because your personal information has been stored in our backup archives), then we securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br>

About your customers<br>

Any information that you add on your B2B Wave platform about your customers will be deleted when there is no ongoing legitimate business need (e.g. if you cancel your account).<br>

You can also request a clean-up/removal of order data placed before a certain period (e.g. more than two years old). If you do not need your data retained after a specific period of time, please send us your request at privacy@b2bwave.com.<br>

Third-party accounts<br>

If you choose to link our services to a third-party account, we will receive information about that account, such as your authentication token from the third-party account in order to authorize linking. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options.<br>

For example, if you link your Quickbooks account to B2B Wave, we receive information from your Quickbooks account. You can always unlink a service from a third-party account, or send us a request to do it for you at privacy@b2bwave.com.<br>

How we share your information<br>

Vendors and Service Providers. We may share information with third-party vendors and service providers that provide services on our behalf and to provide you with information relevant to you such as product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information. An extensive list of what our main service providers do, follows in the next section.<br>
Aggregated Information. Where legally permissible, we may use and share information about users with our partners in an aggregated or de-identified form that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.<br>
Third-Party Partners. We also share information about our users with third-party partners in order to receive additional and publicly available information about you.<br>

Should you require a full list of our sub-processors, please send us an email at privacy@b2bwave.com.<br>

Legal basis for processing personal information<br>

Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information shared and the specific context in which we collect it.<br>

However, we normally collect personal information from you only:<br>

when we need the personal information to perform a contract with you
in case the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights or
when we have your consent to do so
when we have a legitimate interest in operating our services and communicating with you as necessary to provide these services. For example, when responding to your queries, when asking you how to improve our platform, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.<br>
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need your personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.<br>

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences, if you do not provide your personal information).<br>

The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.<br>

The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about how our website is used. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html.<br>

to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset that we are (or are contemplating) selling<br>
